## LJ-FlowLogging
---

Use a LabJack to track fluid volume flow through a positive displacement flow sensor (Hall-Effect)

The hall-effect sensor outputs a square pulse every revolution of the internal gear (volume specific to flow sensor).
The goal is to measure this with the LabJack to get a flow rate
